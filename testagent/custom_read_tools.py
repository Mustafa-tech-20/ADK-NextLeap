    Parses a raw string of candidate data, manually validates each record, and saves valid ones to MongoDB.

    This tool handles the entire workflow from raw text to database entry.
    It manually parses the string line-by-line and applies the following validation rules:

    - Rule 1: A 'First Name', 'Last Name', and 'Email' must be present for each candidate.
    - Rule 2: The 'Gender' must be either 'Male' or 'Female' (case-insensitive).
    - Rule 3: A 'Role' field for each candidate must be present regarding what role they are applying for.
    - Rule 4: Each candidate record must have the same number of fields as the header row.

    Records that fail validation are discarded.

    Args:
        raw_data_string (str): A single string containing candidate data, with each candidate on a new line
